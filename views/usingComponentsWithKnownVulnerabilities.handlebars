	<p>As developers, we often solely focus on functionality of the software we are writing, very rarely do we think abou security.  We'll often incorporate libraries that help us get our job done, but we don't do our due diligence in researching possible vulnerabilities associated with those libraries.  The security often gets overlooked.</p>
    <h3 id="demonstration">Demonstration</h3>
    <p>Our Web Application makes use of the node package <span class="bold">"node-serialize"</span> to serialize and deserialize objects.  The <span class="bold">"node-serialize"</span> library has a CVE (Common Vulnerability and Exposure) associated with it</p>
    <p><a href="https://www.cvedetails.com/cve/CVE-2017-5941/">CVE-2017-5941</a> contains a description and links to proof of concept exploit code for the node-serialize library</p>
    <p>For an in-depth demonstration on how to exploit a component with a known vulnerability, please refer to our Insecure Deserialization section, where you'll be taken through a step-by-step guide on how to exploit the <span class="bold">"node-serialize"</span> library.
    <h3>Remediation</h3>
    <p>A mitigation technique to discover vulnerabilities against our web application is to manually check the libraries and version against exploit databases, CVEs, etc.  This is how we discovered the vulnerability with <span class="bold">node serialize v.0.0.4</span>, however, there are more efficient methods to do so.  As developers we can employ automated scanners, such as <a href="https://www.tenable.com">Tenable's Nessus</a> or <a href="https://www.openvas.org">Openvas</a>.
    <p>Automated scanners enables developers to continuously monitor their web application for current and new vulnerabilities not only in our web applications, but in all software running on our Host system.  Very rarely do hackers rely on one vulnerability to gain control of a system.  Systems are usually "rooted" by chaining multiple exploits together.  Automated scanners are an effective way to discover vulnerabilities and address "low hanging fruit".</p>

    <p>Once a component with a known vulnerability is discovered, developers should seek to remove that component from their application, or mitigate the vulnerability.  In the Insecure Deserialization section, we mitigated the vulnerability with the use of the <span class="codeBlock">JSON.stringify</span> function.  A more preferable solution, would be to use another library that provides the same functionality, but without vulnerabilty.</p>
    <p>The nodejs <span class="bold">v8</span> provides us such a capability. It allows to serialize and deserialize object<p>
    <p>Our code to serialize user input is now:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">var v8 = require('v8')<br>
    var obj = req.body.userInput<br>
    var serialized = v8.serialize(obj)<br>
    var json = JSON.stringify(serialized)</p>

    <p>Here we'll serialize an object:<p>
    <p class="codeBlock">{{benign}}</p>
            <form action="/usingComponentsWithKnownVulnerabilities/serialize" method="post">
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>safeComponent</legend>
                        <label>User Input:
                            <input type="hidden" name="type" value="default">
                            <input type="textarea" name="userInput" placeholder="User Input" required>
                        </label>
                        <input type="submit" value="Serialize"/>
                </fieldset>
            </form>

        <p>Result:</p>
        {{#if serialized}}
        <table class="markdown">
            <tr>
                <th>Serialized Object</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="text_small">
		<td>{{serialized}}</td>
            <tr>
        </table>
        {{else}}<span class="deselected">[...]<br></span>
        {{/if}}

    <p>Our code to deserialize an object is now:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">var obj = Buffer.from(JSON.parse(req.body.userInput).data)<br>
    var deserialized = obj.toString('utf8')<br></p>
    <p>To deserialize the object, type the following into the form:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">{{test}}</p>
            <form action="/usingComponentsWithKnownVulnerabilities/deserialize" method="post">
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>safeComponent</legend>
                        <label>User Input:
                            <input type="hidden" name="type" value="default">
                            <input type="textarea" name="userInput" placeholder="User Input" required>
                        </label>
                        <input type="submit" value="Deserialize"/>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
        <p>Result:</p>
        {{#if deserialized}}
        <table class="markdown">
            <tr>
                <th>Deserialized Object</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="text_small">
		<td>{{deserialized}}</td>
            <tr>
        </table>
	{{else if error}}
        <table class="markdown">
            <tr>
                <th>Error Message</th>
            </tr>
            <tr class="text_small">
		<td>{{error}}</td>
            <tr>
	</table>
	<p>We now receive a error message, instead of a BIND shell</p>
        {{else}}<span class="deselected">[...]<br></span>
        {{/if}}

    <p>As in the Insecure Deserialization Section, attempt to start up a BIND shell on our webserver, by deserializing the following malicious input in the form above:<p>
    <p class="codeBlock">{{payload}}</p>
