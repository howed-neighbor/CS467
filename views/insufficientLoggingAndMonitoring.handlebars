Ensuring that all events are logged, and events monitored, as a result, is often considered a first step in intrusion detection.</td>

        <h3>Demonstratation</h3>

        <p><span class="bold">Insufficient Logging and Monitoring</span> is not necessarily a vulnerability that can be exploited, however, it makes an attack on system more likely to succeed.  The absence of logging and monitoring means that it is almost impossible to detect an attack on a system and thus prevents any response or mitigative actions from taking place.</p>

        <h3>Remediation</h3>
        <p><p>Our remediation makes use of <span class="bold">Snort</span>. To see this remediation, please head to our <a href="http://ec2-157-175-92-30.me-south-1.compute.amazonaws.com:37773/insufficientLoggingAndMonitoring">AWS EC2 instance</a> and try the exercises there, which will trigger our web application to start up Snort.<p>

        Snort is an Intrustion Detection System (IDS) and is installed on our host operating system in our AWS EC2 instance.</p>

        <p>In the logs we can see your IP, or the IP of the attacker attempting to exploit our web application.</p>

        <p>This demonstration shows how powerful logging and monitoring can be, it can help defenders identify possible intrusions into their system.  However, an IDS is only as good as the rules that written for it.  Additionally, defenders must also be skilled in reviewing logs.  In our example we only had two attacks, in an enterprise system, their could potentially be hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands of alerts.</p>
