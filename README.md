# CS467: Website Security Research Project

This project will explore the web vulnerabilities outlined at https://www.vpnmentor.com/blog/top-10-common-web-attacks/ (D. Avi, accessed Dec 2021-Jan 2022). These vulnerabilities are categorized as follows:

* [Injection](#injection)
* [Broken Authentication](#broken-authentication)
* [Sensitive Data Exposure](#sensitive-data-exposure)
* [XML External Entities](#xml-external-entities)
* [Broken Access Control](#broken-access-control)
* [Security Misconfiguration](#security-misconfiguration)
* [Cross-Site Scripting](#cross-site-scripting)
* [Insecure Deserialization](#insecure-deserialization)
* [Using Components with Known Vulnerabilities](#using-components-with-known-vulnerabilities)
* [Insufficient Logging & Monitoring](#insufficient-logging--monitoring)

These vulnerabilities will be explored through a demonstration app, datapotato.io:
