    <h1>Insecure Deserialization</h1>
    <hr class="light">

    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>In order to understand what <span class="bold">Insecure Deserialization</span> is, we must first define <span class="bold">serialization.</span></p>

    <p>Wikipedia defines <span class="bold">serialization</span> as the process of translating a data structure or object state into a format that can be stored (e.g. in a file or memory buffer) or transmitted (e.g. over a network) and reconstructed later (possibly in a different computer envrinoment). When the resulting series of bits is re-read according to the serialization format, it can be used to create a semantically identical clone of the original object.

        <td><span class="bold">Inseucre Deserialization</span> is a vulnerability in which an untrusted or unknown data is used to either inflict a DoS, execute code, bypass authentication or further abuse logic behind the application. <span class="bold">Serialization</span> is the proces that converts an object to a format that can be later restored. <span class="bold">Deserialization</span> is the opposing process which takes data from a file, stream or network and rebuilds it into an object.</td>

    <h2>Remediation</h2>
    <p>We can mitigate/prevent this vulnerability from being exploited by sanitizing user input.<p>
    <p>In our sanitized code, we make use of the <code>JSON.stringify</code> function:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">var serialze = require('node-serialize')<br>
    var obj = req.body.userInput<br>
    var sanitized = JSON.stringify(obj)<br>
    var deserialized = serialize.unserialize(sanitized)</p>

    <p>If we attempt to enter the malicious code again, and try to connect to the BIND shell, it will fail.</p> 
    <p>Attempt to enter the following code again in our sanitized form:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">{{payload}}</p>

            <form action="/insecureDeserialization/sanitized#demonstration" method="post">
                <fieldset>
                    <legend>sanitizedDeserialization</legend>
                        <label>User Input:
                            <input type="hidden" name="type" value="default">
                            <input type="textarea" name="userInput" placeholder="User Input" required>
                        </label>
                        <input type="submit" value="Sanitized"/>
                </fieldset>
            </form>
        </p>

    <p>Our web application can now safely deserialize the user input:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">{test:123}</p> <!--This was originally {{deserialized}}, changed to plain text in case end user doesn't go through demonstration forms-->
    <p>If you attempt to connect to the BIND shell, it no longer works. Try it:</p>
    <p>If visiting the web application on our AWS instance:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">nc -vn 157.175.92.30 4444</p>
    <p>If visiting the web application on the flip server:</p>
    <p class="codeBlock">nc -vn 127.0.0.1 4444</p>
